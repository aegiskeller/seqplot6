<h1>Seqplot Revisited</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>

It is an evolved version of seqplot5.7.1 from AAVSO Sequence Team. It is used to construct sequences of calibration stars around variable stars of interest.

<h2>Why a new version?</h2>

Previous methods have relied on manul processes of copying rows from a CDS Vizier search, dropping into a spreadsheet to perform the photometric transformations and then copying the results to a .txt file for submission to VSD. This manual process can be frustrating and raises the opportunity of errors. 

The new tool bakes in the rules for sequence construction and photometric transformation. It aims to expedite the boring stuff and allow the sequencer to concentrate on the skillful choice of comparison stars
