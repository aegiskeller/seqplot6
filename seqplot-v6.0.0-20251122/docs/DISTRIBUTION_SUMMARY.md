# Seqplot v6.0.0 - Improved Distribution Package

## Summary of Changes

Your user's feedback was spot-on! I've completely redesigned the distribution to be **"straight out of the box"** friendly.

## What's New

### 1. **Executable JAR File** (Seqplot-6.0.0.jar)
- Single-click to run on any platform
- All libraries bundled inside (2.1 MB)
- No installation or unpacking needed
- Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

### 2. **Smart Windows Launcher** (Seqplot.bat)
- Checks if Java is installed
- Shows Java version
- Provides helpful error messages with download links
- Guides user through Java installation if needed

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- **START_HERE.txt** - Big, friendly quick start guide
- **WINDOWS_README.txt** - Detailed Windows setup with troubleshooting
- **README.txt** - Full feature list and usage guide
- **CHANGELOG.txt** - Version history

## How Users Run It

### Method 1: Double-click JAR (Easiest)
```
Just double-click: Seqplot-6.0.0.jar
```

### Method 2: Use the launcher
```
Windows: Double-click Seqplot.bat
Mac/Linux: Double-click run.sh
```

### Method 3: Command line
```
java -jar Seqplot-6.0.0.jar
```

## What Users Need

**Only requirement:** Java 11 or newer

- Free download: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/
- Seqplot.bat will detect if it's missing and provide the link
- Most systems already have Java installed

## Distribution Files

Created two packages:
- `seqplot-v6.0.0-20251114.zip` (for Windows users)
- `seqplot-v6.0.0-20251114.tar.gz` (for Mac/Linux users)

Both contain identical files.

## Benefits

✅ No need to install "another bit of software" beyond Java  
✅ Works "straight out of the box"  
✅ Clear error messages if Java is missing  
✅ Multiple ways to launch (flexibility)  
✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting docs  
✅ Same package works on all platforms  

## How to Share

1. Send users either the .zip (Windows) or .tar.gz (Mac/Linux)
2. Tell them to extract it
3. Point them to START_HERE.txt
4. Done!

## Testing

The JAR file has been tested and works correctly. Users can verify by running:
```bash
java -jar Seqplot-6.0.0.jar
```
