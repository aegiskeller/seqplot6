Based on the Excel file and D.W. Evans et al. paper on Gaia DR2 photometric transformations,
the standard transformations from Gaia G, BP, RP to Johnson-Cousins V, R, I are:

For stars with BP-RP color (assuming BP < 19 mag as per the constraint):

The transformations use polynomial relationships with BP-RP as the color term.
These are from Evans et al. 2018, A&A 616, A4 (2018), Section A2.

Standard transformations (simplified from the paper):

V = G - (-0.01760 - 0.006860*(BP-RP) - 0.1732*(BP-RP)^2)
or equivalently:
V = G + 0.01760 + 0.006860*(BP-RP) + 0.1732*(BP-RP)^2

For R and I, similar polynomial forms exist but need the actual coefficients from the paper.

The spreadsheet likely implements these exact equations.
Let me check the calculated values in the Process sheet to reverse-engineer the formulas.
